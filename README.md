# ProjectZomboid - Symbolic Link Steam workshop
PS script is for "Project Zomboid", it is supposed to symbolic link steam workshop folders to ".Zomboid\mods" for server modding

For Windows Server or Client, where you can run this in a powershell terminal or right click and "run with powershell", this is meant for linking the steam workshop to the local user directory of your PC (using current user, if you use Admin in powershell it will be in "Administrator\.Zomboid").
